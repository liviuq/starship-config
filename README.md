# starship-config

This is the config I use for starship prompt. Feel free to hack it.

Prerequisites:
 - A [Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads) installed

Installation:

```sh
#install starship from snap ubuntu
sudo snap install starship 

#download this repo with the .toml file
cd
git clone https://github.com/liviuq/starship-config
cd starship-config
cp starship.toml ~/.config/
```
NOTE: This repo will be archived. Reason: creating a "dotfiles" repo instead.
